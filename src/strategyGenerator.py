# This function should be able to generate random strategies, with a starting position and length (all in meters, in terms of cumulative distance along the track)
# It should return the strategy as follows: for example, a 2-acceleration strategy will output: [(0, 100), (500, 50)] where the first value is initial cumulative distance, and the second value the length of acceleration
# Feel free to explore different ideas of generating strategies
