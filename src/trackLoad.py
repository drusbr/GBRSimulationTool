# This function should be able to receive track coordinates (in both Cartesian and/or Latitude/Longitude)
# It should calculate the distance between each point along the track, and consequently calculate  the distance of the lap (i.e. sum of all distances between points)
# It should calculate the elevation gradient at each point, with reasoning behind the choice of lookahead distance
# It should calculate the curvature at each point, and similarly to above, with reasoning behind choice of lookahead distance
